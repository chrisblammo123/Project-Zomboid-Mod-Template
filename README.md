# Project-Zomboid-Mod-Template
Template repository for project zomboid lua mods.

For more information about the `mod.info` file, go to https://pzwiki.net/wiki/Mod.info.

[FWolfe](https://github.com/FWolfe) created a modding guide, which can be found at https://github.com/FWolfe/Zomboid-Modding-Guide/blob/master/structure/README.md.

The batch script `make_project.bat` automatically creates the `mod.info file` and media folder structure, along with the required empty files that allow git to track those empty folders. It, however, does not generate a license.

This template repository uses the CC0 license, but other common options are MIT and GPL.
